HEADER
In HTML4, we would define a header like this:
<div id="header">
In HTML5, a simple <header> tag is used, instead.
The <header> element is appropriate for use inside the body tag.

NAV
This tag represents a section of a page that links to other pages 
or to certain sections within the page. This would be a section with navigation links.

FOOTER
The footer element is also widely used. 
Generally we refer to a section located at the very bottom of the web page as the footer.
