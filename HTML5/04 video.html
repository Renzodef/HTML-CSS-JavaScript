<!--
The video element is similar to the audio element.
You can specify the video source URL using an attribute in a video element, 
or using source elements inside the video element.
Another aspect that the audio and video elements have in common is that the major browsers 
do not all support the same file types. If the browser does not support the first video type, 
it will try the next one.

Attributes of <video>
Another aspect shared by both the audio and the video elements 
is that each has controls, autoplay and loop attributes.
