ARTICLE
Article is a self-contained, independent piece of content that can be used 
and distributed separately from the rest of the page or site. 
This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a comment, 
an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent piece of content.
The <article> element replaces the <div> element that was widely used in HTML4, along with an id or class.

SECTION
<section> is a logical container of the page or article.
Sections can be used to divide up content within an article.
For example, a homepage could have a section for introducing the company, 
another for news items, and still another for contact information.
Each <section> should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) 
as a child of the <section> element.

ASIDE
<aside> is secondary or tangential content which could be considered separate
from but indirectly related to the main content.
This type of content is often represented in sidebars.
When an <aside> tag is used within an <article> tag, 
the content of the <aside> should be specifically related to that article.
