<!--
Before HTML5, there was no standard for playing audio files on a web page.
The HTML5 <audio> element specifies a standard for embedding audio in a web page.

Attributes of <audio>
controls
Specifies that audio controls should be displayed (such as a play/pause button, etc.)

autoplay
When this attribute is defined, audio starts playing as soon as it is ready, without asking for the visitor's permission.
<audio controls autoplay>

loop
This attribute is used to have the audio replay every time it is finished.
<audio controls autoplay loop>

Currently, there are three supported file formats for the <audio> element: MP3, WAV, and OGG.

    <!--
    There are two different ways to specify the audio source file's URL. 
    The first uses the source attribute:
    -->
    <audio src="audio.mp3" controls>
        Audio element not supported by your browser
    </audio>
    <!--
    The second way uses the <source> element inside the <audio> element.
    Multiple <source> elements can be linked to different audio files. 
    The browser will use the first recognized format.
    -->
    <audio controls>
        <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>
</body>
