<!--
HTML5 brings many features and improvements to web form creation. 
There are new attributes and input types that were introduced to help create better experiences for web users.
Form creation is done in HTML5 the same way as it was in HTML4.

NEW ATTRIBUTES
HTML5 has introduced a new attribute called placeholder. 
On <input> and <textarea> elements,
this attribute provides a hint to the user of what information can be entered into the field.

The "required" attribute is used to make the input elements required.
