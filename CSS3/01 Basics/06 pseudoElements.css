Working with Pseudo Elements
Pseudo elements are used to select specific parts of an element.
There are five pseudo elements in CSS, each starting with a double colon (::):
::first-line - the first line of the text in a selector
::first-letter - the first letter of the text in a selector
::selection - selects the portion of an element that is selected by a user
::before - inserts some content before an element
::after - inserts some content after an element
*/
p::selection {
    color: #589432;
