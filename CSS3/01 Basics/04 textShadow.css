/*
The text-shadow Property
The text-shadow property defines one or more comma-separated shadow effects, 
to be applied to the text content of the current element.

Values
- The offset-x and offset-y values are required for the CSS text-shadow property.
- The color value is not required, but since the default for the text-shadow is transparent, 
    the text-shadow will not appear unless you specify a color value.

Multiple Text Shadows
The text-shadow style can accept multiple values in a comma-separated list.
According to CSS2, the shadows are laid down in the order they appear, 
so if they overlap, the last one that is specified should appear on top. 
CSS3 has now changed that so they are applied in reverse order.
To create multiple shadows, the shadows are separated with a comma.
