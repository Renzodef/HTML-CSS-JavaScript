/*
CSS vendor prefixes or CSS browser prefixes are a way for browser makers to add support for new 
CSS features during periods of testing and experimentation. 
Browser prefixes are used to add new features that may not be part of the final and formal CSS specification.
For example, the prefix for Safari and Chrome is -webkit. 
The border-radius property is currently supported in Chrome, Safari, and Mozilla, 
as long as it is accompanied by the browser prefix.
To specify the border-radius in Chrome and Safari, the following syntax is used:
-webkit-border-radius: 24px;
*/
.round {
    -webkit-border-radius: 24px;
    border-radius: 24px;
    border: 1px solid green;
    width: 200px;
    padding: 25px;
}

-o- (Opera)
-ms- (Internet Explorer)
-webkit- (Safari, Chrome)
It might feel annoying and repetitive to have to write the properties two to five 
times to get them to work in all browsers, but it's temporary. 
As browsers improve, they add support for the standards based version of the properties, 
and you can remove the prefixed versions.
