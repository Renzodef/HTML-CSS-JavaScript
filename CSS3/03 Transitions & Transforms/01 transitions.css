CSS3 Transitions
CSS3 transitions allow us to change from one property value to another over a given duration.
transition-property - specifies the property to be transitioned
transition-duration - specifies the duration over which transitions should occur
transition-timing-function - specifies how the pace of the transition changes over its duration
transition-delay - specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect
