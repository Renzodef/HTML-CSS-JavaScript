/*
The animation-name Property
animation-name property defines which animation to use.

The animation-duration Property
The animation-duration property specifies the duration of the selected animation in seconds.
If the animation name does not match any keyframe rule, the animation will not execute.

The animation-timing-function Property
It can have the following values:
ease - specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - specifies an animation with a slow start
ease-out - specifies an animation with a slow end
ease-in-out - specifies an animation with a slow start and end
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function

More Animation Properties
The animation-iteration-count property determines the number of times an animation repeats.
For example, you can set the animation to run 5 times:
animation-iteration-count: 5;
To make the animation repeat forever, just use the infinite value:
animation-iteration-count: infinite;
The animation-direction indicates how the keyframe should be applied.
The values can be set as:
normal - the default value, which means it plays forward from 0 % to 100%.
reverse - plays the keyframe in an opposite direction from 100 % to 0%
alternate - the animation first runs forward, then backward, then forward.
alternate-reverse - the animation first runs backward, then forward, then backward.
If you use 0 or a negative number for the animation-iteration-count, the animation will never start.

Consider the following example:

div {
   animation-name: colorchange;
   animation-duration: 3s;
   animation-timing-function: ease-in;
   animation-delay: 1s;
   animation-iteration-count: infinite;
   animation-direction: reverse;
}

A single animation property can be used to achieve the same result as the above code:

div { 
   animation: colorchange 3s ease-in 1s infinite reverse;
}
*/

div {
    animation: colorchange 3s ease-in 1s infinite alternate;
    -webkit-animation: colorchange 3s ease-in 1s infinite alternate;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: red;
    width: 0px;
}

@keyframes colorchange {
    from {
        width: 0px;
    }

    to {
        width: 100px;
    }
}

@-webkit-keyframes colorchange {
    from {
        width: 0px;
    }

    to {
        width: 100px;
    }
}
