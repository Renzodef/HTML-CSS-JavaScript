/*
The scale() Method
The scale() method increases or decreases the size of an element, 
according to the parameters given for the width and height. 
1 stands for the original size, 2 for twice the original size, and so on.
In the example below, we decreased the first div by the factor 0.7 both horizontally and vertically, 
and increased the second div by a factor of 1.5 horizontally and vertically.
*/
div.first {
   width: 200px;
   height: 100px;
   background-color: #8BC34A;
   transform: scale(0.7, 0.7);
   color:white;
}
div.second {
   margin: 60px;
   width: 200px;
   height: 100px;
   background-color: #8bc34a;
   transform: scale(1.5,1.5);
   color:white;
