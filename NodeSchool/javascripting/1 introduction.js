// Create a file named introduction.js.
// Open the file in your favorite editor, and add this text:
// console.log('hello')
// Save the file, then check to see if your program is correct by running this command:
// javascripting verify introduction.js
// By the way, throughout this tutorial, you can give the file you work with
// any name you like, so if you want to use something like catsAreAwesome.js
// file for every exercise, you can do that. Just make sure to run:
// javascripting verify catsAreAwesome.js
console.log('hello');
