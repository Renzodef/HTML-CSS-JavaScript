        Alert Box
        An alert box is used when you want to ensure that information gets through to the user.
        When an alert box pops up, the user must click OK to proceed.
        The alert function takes a single parameter, which is the text displayed in the popup box.
        Example:
        */
        alert("Do you really want to leave this page?");
    </script>
