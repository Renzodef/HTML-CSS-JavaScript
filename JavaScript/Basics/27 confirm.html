        Confirm Box
        A confirm box is often used to have the user verify or accept something.
        When a confirm box pops up, the user must click either OK or Cancel to proceed.
        If the user clicks OK, the box returns true. If the user clicks Cancel, the box returns false.
        Example:
        */
        var result = confirm("Do you really want to leave this page?");
        if (result == true) {
            alert("Thanks for visiting");
        }
        else {
            alert("Thanks for staying with us");
        }
