/*
he visibility property specifies whether an element is visible or hidden. 
The most common values are visible and hidden.
Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to "none" 
or the visibility property to "hidden". 
However, notice that these two methods produce different results:
visibility:hidden hides an element, but it will still take up the same space as before. 
The element will be hidden, but it will still affect the layout.
