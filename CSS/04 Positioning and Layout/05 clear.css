/*
Clearing the Float
Elements that come after the floating element will flow around it. 
To avoid this, use the clear property.
The clear property specifies the sides of an element where other floating elements are not allowed to be.

If we set the float property to a div,
only the paragraph that comes after the div will be wrapped around the image.

Using clear
Use the values right, left, and both to specify the sides of 
an element where other floating elements are not allowed to be.

both is used to clear floats coming from either direction.
