/*
Links can be styled with any CSS property (e.g., color, font-family, background, etc.).
In addition, links can be styled differently, depending on what state they are in. 
The following pseudo selectors are available:
a:link - defines the style for normal unvisited links
a:visited - defines the style for visited links
a:active - a link becomes active once you click on it
a:hover - a link is hovered when the mouse is over it
*/

a:hover {
    color: red;
}

a:link {
    text-decoration: none;
}
